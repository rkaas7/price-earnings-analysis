# ðŸ“Š Price/Earnings analysis for your Watchlist of longterm Investments

This tool provides a clean and insightful web interface to visualize Price/Earnings ratios (P/E) of selected companies, helping to identify potentially undervalued stocks.

**Keep in mind:** P/E ratios arenâ€™t the full story - but theyâ€™re a great way to get a quick sense of how your favorite companies (e.g. some Consumer Staples) are currently valued. Itâ€™s not about drawing conclusions at a glance, but spotting where things look interesting enough to dig deeper.

The dashboard displays:

- **Trailing P/E**: Price divided by the most recent 12-month earnings.
- **Forward P/E**: Price divided by projected 12-month earnings ('forwardPE' from yfinance).
- **Long-Term Average P/E**: Historical valuation benchmark (manually defined, or estimated by the tool (data not available on yahoo finance) ).

Use filters for **index** and **sector**. 

**Data is fetched from Yahoo Finance (via yfinance)**
